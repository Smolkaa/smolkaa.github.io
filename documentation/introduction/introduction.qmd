Space exploration has always captivated humanity's imagination, driving scientific inquiry and technological advancement to unprecedented heights. While the Moon's surface has been a focal point of human exploration, its tenuous exosphere, a fragile envelope of particles and gases, has long remained an understudied frontier. Recent decades have witnessed remarkable strides in our understanding of extraterrestrial exospheres, with a particular focus on the Moon's exosphere and its intricate interactions with the lunar surface.

Advances in space exploration have unveiled the Moon's exosphere as a realm of astonishing complexity. Notable missions such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ([LRO](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) have played a pivotal role in unraveling the mysteries of the lunar exosphere. The orbiter mission has not only provided the most highly resolved images of the Moon's surface, see [Fig. @fig-LROC_poles] showing high-resolution mosaic images of the lunar's north and south poles, but the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project ([LAMP](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) [@Gladstone2009] aboard [LRO](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) has studied the exosphere by analyzing the scattering of ultraviolet sunlight. Additionally, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ([LADEE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) mission's Neutral Mass Spectrometer ([NMS](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) [@Benna2015] provided valuable insights into the composition of the exosphere and its temporal variations. These missions collectively painted a new picture of the Moon - a dynamic world with a delicate exosphere shaped by intricate surface interactions.


However, the first endeavors to investigate the lunar exosphere were already made decades earlier, during the Apollo program, during which the Lunar Atmosphere Composition Experiment ([LACE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) instrument was deployed on the Moon's surface by Apollo 17 as part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package ([ALSEP](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) [@Chang1972]. [LACE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) marked the first direct detection of exospheric species, capturing trace amounts of noble gases and demonstrating the existence of a lunar atmosphere. This historic endeavor laid the foundation for our present understanding, highlighting the complexity of the lunar exosphere and the need for continued exploration.

In the broader scope of planetary science, beyond the lunar realm, lies a captivating tapestry of exospheric phenomena across our solar system. Among these, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has beckoned explorers and researchers alike. Pioneering missions such as [NASA's MESSENGER](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) have revealed the intricate details of Mercury's exosphere. [MESSENGER's](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) observations have unraveled the complex interplay between the planet's surface and its tenuous envelope of gases, shedding light on the origins of exospheric constituents and their dynamic behavior in response to solar wind interactions. Through these missions, the study of exospheres extends its reach beyond Earth's celestial companion, contributing valuable insights to the broader understanding of planetary atmospheres and their interactions with the space environment.


# Background and Motivation

## State of the Art {#sec-sota}

One of the first modelers of the lunar exosphere was @Hodges1973, who analyzed light noble gases as well as volatile molecular hydrogen and compared their results with data from the Apollo missions. Their Monte-Carlo approach of tracking individual particles through the tenuous atmosphere until eventually lost to one of the implemented loss mechanisms was pioneering work that still inspires new models today. With @Chamberlain1963, @Armand1977, and @Huebner1992 setting the theoretical foundation of exospheric density projections, thermal velocity distributions, and lunar exospheric photoreaction rates, respectively, models became increasingly adapted to predicting number densities in surface-bounded exospheres.

While previously, only single-species simulations with mostly noble gases were performed, @Crider2002 were among the first to investigate the highly reactive hydrogen exosphere, which includes reaction pathways to allow conversions from atomic hydrogen to more complex molecules like water. Their research led to a heightened interest in the role of the planetary surface in exosphere densities and compositions. @Farrell2015, @Farrell2017, @Jones2018, @Jones2021, @Tucker2018, @Tucker2021, @Grumpe2019 are among the leading researchers to investigate the proton/hydrogen interaction with lunar regolith, trying to untangle the highly complex physical and chemical reaction environment of the lunar surface.

## The Problem of Scales

One of the most prominent problems for exosphere models is based on the enormous difference in physical scales between relevant processes. While the dimensions of the respective planetary object and its topographic features are around hundreds of kilometers, surface and subsurface processes like particle releases or diffusion are described on micro and sometimes down to atomic scales [@Milillo2023].
