Space exploration has always captivated humanity's imagination, driving scientific inquiry and technological advancement to unprecedented heights. While the Moon's surface has been a focal point of human exploration, its tenuous exosphere, a fragile envelope of particles and gases, has long remained an understudied frontier. Recent decades have witnessed remarkable strides in our understanding of extraterrestrial exospheres, with a particular focus on the Moon's exosphere and its intricate interactions with the lunar surface.

Advances in space exploration have unveiled the Moon's exosphere as a realm of astonishing complexity. Notable missions such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ([LRO](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) have played a pivotal role in unraveling the mysteries of the lunar exosphere. The orbiter mission has not only provided the most highly resolved images of the Moon's surface, see [Fig. @fig-LROC_poles] showing high-resolution mosaic images of the lunar's north and south pole, but the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project ([LAMP](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) [@Gladstone2009] aboard [LRO](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) has studied the exosphere by analyzing the scattering of ultraviolet sunlight. Additionally, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ([LADEE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) mission's Neutral Mass Spectrometer ([NMS](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) [@Benna2015] provided valuable insights into the composition of the exosphere and its temporal variations. These missions collectively painted a new picture of the Moon - a dynamic world with a delicate exosphere shaped by intricate surface interactions.

However, the first endeavors to investigate the lunar exosphere were already made decades earlier, during the Apollo program, during which the Lunar Atmosphere Composition Experiment ([LACE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) instrument was deployed on the Moon's surface by Apollo 17 as part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package ([ALSEP](/documentation/acronyms.qmd)) [@Chang1972]. [LACE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) marked the first direct detection of exospheric species, capturing trace amounts of noble gases and demonstrating the existence of a lunar atmosphere. This historic endeavor laid the foundation for our present understanding, highlighting the complexity of the lunar exosphere and the need for continued exploration.

In the broader scope of planetary science, beyond the lunar realm, lies a captivating tapestry of exospheric phenomena across our solar system. Among these, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has beckoned explorers and researchers alike. Pioneering missions such as [NASA's MESSENGER](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) have revealed the intricate details of Mercury's exosphere. [MESSENGER's](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) observations have unraveled the complex interplay between the planet's surface and its tenuous envelope of gases, shedding light on the origins of exospheric constituents and their dynamic behavior in response to solar wind interactions. Through these missions, the study of exospheres extends its reach beyond Earth's celestial companion, contributing valuable insights to the broader understanding of planetary atmospheres and their interactions with the space environment.
