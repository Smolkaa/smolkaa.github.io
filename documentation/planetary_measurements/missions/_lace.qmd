The [LACE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) (Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment) on the Apollo 17 mission was part of the [ALSEP](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) (Apollo lunar Surface Experiments Package) to investigate the composition and variation of the Moon's exosphere. Specifically designed for the mission, the instrument consisted of a small, remotely operated package containing a mass spectrometer coupled with a pressure sensor. With its opening oriented upward, it was able to measure the downward stream of particles at the lunar surface at the Apollo 17 landing location, the Taurus-Littrow valley. On December 27, 1971, the instrument was activated to start the data acquisition process $\SI{50}{\hour}$ after local sunset to operate through one entire lunar night. Increasing exopheric number densities at the morning-terminator as well as higher outgassing rates lead to elevated background gas levels prompted the temporary suspension of operations during the lunar day, except a short check near $\SI{12}{\hour}$ local time. In total, the [LACE](/documentation/acronyms.qmd) measured the nighttime densities for nine lunations. [@Hoffman1975; @Killen2019]


The instrument's mass spectrometer measured the mass per unit charge ratio up to a maximum of $\SI{110}{}$ in three mass ranges $\SI{1}{}$ to $\SI{4}{}$, $\SI{12}{}$ to $\SI{48}{}$, and $\SI{27.4}{}$ to $\SI{110}{}$ termed low, medium, and high. A triple-channel analyzer was able to capture data from all three ranges simultaneously as counts per $\SI{0.6}{\second}$ at every voltage step [@Hoffman1975]. Note that due to the measurement technique ambiguous data points of particles with double mass being doubly ionized were taken [@Killen2019].
