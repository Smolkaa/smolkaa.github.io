This section lists referenced values of the lunar exosphere surface densities, generally provided as a number density in $\left[\si{\centi\metre\tothe{-3}}\right]$. Some references are providing their values in terms of a column density in $\left[\si{\centi\metre\tothe{-2}}\right]$, which includes the respectives measurements coulumn height, i.e., the illuminated line of sight of brightness measurements like LAMP.

## Additional Information {.appendix}

* @Gladstone2009 assume for the LAMP derivations a  $\SI{30}{\minute}$, $3\sigma$ observation, and a path length of $\SI{300}{\kilo\metre}$.
* @Hodges1973 assumed a solar wind proton influx of $3 \times 10^8 \si{\second\tothe{-1}\centi\metre\tothe{-3}}$ for their simulations.
