The heights of the local structured grid are increasing exponentially. To derivate the height of the $i$-th grid element $\cartesianCoordinateZ_i$, start at the basic 3-free-parameter exponential function:
\begin{equation}
    \cartesianCoordinateZ_i = a + b \exp\left(c\right)^i.
\end{equation}
We can now add two constraints to this function: first, the bottom of the local grid, which is the zeroth element of the grid, is $\cartesianCoordinateZ_0=0$, and the last element of the grid at the $i = N_\cartesianCoordinateZ$ index has to be at the maximum height of the grid, $\cartesianCoordinateZ_{N_\cartesianCoordinateZ} = \cartesianCoordinateZ_{max}$. With these two conditions, two of the three free parameters can be solved, leaving only the exponential shape parameter $c$:
\begin{equation}
    \cartesianCoordinateZ_i = \cartesianCoordinateZ_{max} \cdot \frac{\exp\left(c\right)^i - 1}{\exp\left(c\right)^{N_\cartesianCoordinateZ} - 1}.
\end{equation}
The local structured grids in this work add another condition to the function to further simplify it and to ensure similar spacings for varying grid sizes, which is $c = 1/N_\cartesianCoordinateZ$, which further reduces the equation to
\begin{equation}
    \cartesianCoordinateZ_i = \cartesianCoordinateZ_{max} \cdot \frac{\exp\left(\frac{1}{N_\cartesianCoordinateZ}\right)^i - 1}{e - 1},
\end{equation}
with Euler's constant $e$. This addition leads to an equal ratio between the maximum grid height and the first element, invariant of the number of vertical grid elements.
