Stuff about thermal sorption.


# Velocity Distributions

The following sections, [3.2.1 Maxwell-Boltzmann Velocity Distribution](/documentation/drivers/thermal_sorption/maxwell_boltzmann_distribution.qmd) and [3.2.2 Maxwell-Boltzmann Flux Velocity Distribution](/documentation/drivers/thermal_sorption/maxwell_boltzmann_flux_distribution.qmd), cover the theoretical description of velocity distributions used to describe the thermal sorption mechanics. Note that the velocities are generally given either in their spherical form, i.e. their speed $\velocity$, the azimuth angle $\sphericalCoordinateAzimuth$, and the elevation angle $\sphericalCoordinateElevation$, or in their cartesian form, i.e. the velocity components $\velocity_\cartesianCoordinateX$, $\velocity_\cartesianCoordinateY$, and $\velocity_\cartesianCoordinateZ$. In the spherical expression, the angles are based on the local surface, i.e. the azimuth describes the horizontal angle and the elevation describes the vertical angle. For the cartesian description, a local reference frame is used (see [Coordinate Systems, Reference Frames](/documentation/fundamentals/coordinate_systems.qmd#sec-reference_frames)), which means that the $\cartesianCoordinateX$ and $\cartesianCoordinateY$ direction describe the horizontal towards the local surface, and the $\cartesianCoordinateZ$ describes the vertical velocity.
