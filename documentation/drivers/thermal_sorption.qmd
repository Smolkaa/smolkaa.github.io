Stuff about thermal sorption.

* Thermal desorption occurs when the thermal energy of an atom exceeds its binding energy at grain surfaces, leading to the release of the particle. At the surface, these particles are released into the exosphere (Moroni, 2023)
* As the name suggests, the process is highly dependent on the temperature and, thus, on the solar photon flux ($\SI{3 \times 10^{15}}{\centi\metre\tothe{2}\per\second}$) (Moroni, 2023)

# Velocity Distributions

The following sections, [3.2.1 Maxwell-Boltzmann Velocity Distribution](/documentation/drivers/thermal_sorption/maxwell_boltzmann_distribution.qmd) and [3.2.2 Maxwell-Boltzmann Flux Velocity Distribution](/documentation/drivers/thermal_sorption/maxwell_boltzmann_flux_distribution.qmd), cover the theoretical description of velocity distributions used to describe the thermal sorption mechanics. Note that the velocities are generally given either in their spherical form, i.e. their speed $\velocity$, the azimuth angle $\sphericalCoordinateAzimuth$, and the elevation angle $\sphericalCoordinateElevation$, or in their cartesian form, i.e. the velocity components $\velocity_\cartesianCoordinateX$, $\velocity_\cartesianCoordinateY$, and $\velocity_\cartesianCoordinateZ$. In the spherical expression, the angles are based on the local surface, i.e. the azimuth describes the horizontal angle and the elevation describes the vertical angle. For the cartesian description, a local reference frame is used (see [Coordinate Systems, Reference Frames](/documentation/fundamentals/coordinate_systems.qmd#sec-reference_frames)), which means that the $\cartesianCoordinateX$ and $\cartesianCoordinateY$ direction describe the horizontal towards the local surface, and the $\cartesianCoordinateZ$ describes the vertical velocity.
