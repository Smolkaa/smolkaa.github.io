Collection of ten atomic hydrogen-like single-electron orbitals showing 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d and 4f orbitals. The angular momentum quantum number l is denoted in each column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code ("s" means l=0; "p": l=1; "d": l=2; "f": l=3). The main quantum number n (=1,2,3,4,...) is marked to the right of each row. All orbitals are aligned along the z-axis and the magnetic quantum number m has been set to 0. The images are 3D renderings of the spatial density distributions. The spatial distribution is smooth and vanishes for large radii. The cloud is a more realistic representation of an orbital than the more common solid-body approximations.
