The analyses of this work will regularly include statements about a statistical ensemble of samples, i.e. of thermodynamic particles in equilibrium. Following @Schoerghofer2022 derivation and notation, given any \gls{pdf}, $f(x)$, the ensemble average of a quantity $Y$ is
\begin{equation}
    \meanof{Y} = \int Yf(x)dx. \label{eq:ensemble_average}
\end{equation}
