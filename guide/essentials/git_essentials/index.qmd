Collaboration with Git and the Git workflow are essential aspects of modern software development. Git, a powerful version control system, enables seamless collaboration among developers by facilitating code sharing, tracking changes, and resolving conflicts. The Git workflow refers to a structured approach to managing team-based coding projects, encompassing branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews. 

This page provides a collection of online materials that delve into essential concepts, ranging from fundamental Git commands to advanced collaboration techniques.
