## Installation

This simulation tool was created as a custom package for the computer language Julia. Please refer to the [official guide](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) to installing Julia on your machine. To be able to use the `ExESS` package, the entire repository has to be downloaded from LRZ-GitLab. Afterward, the code can be used in several different ways. The entire module can be included directly by specifying the path of the downloaded package in the `include` call.
```julia
include(joinpath(PathToPackage, "src", "ExESS.jl"))
using .ExESS
```

## Required Packages

The `ExESS` package relies on multiple other packages that have to be added and installed by the user. They can be added using Julia's package-manager `Pkg`:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Interpolations")
Pkg.add("NearestNeighbors")
Pkg.add("DifferentialEquations")
Pkg.add("SpecialFunctions")
```
