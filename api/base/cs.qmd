Coordinates in `ExESS` are implemented as their custom, three-dimensional vectors, which
are based on their scope, the coordinate system, and their physical type. The scope can
either be `Global[...]` or `Local[...]`, which is referring to a fixed planetary system or
a local reference frame, respectively. The coordinate system is either `[...]Cartesian[...]`
or `[...]Spherical[...]`, which is referring to a Cartesian or spherical coordinate system,
respectively. The physical type is either `[...]Position` or `[...]Velocity`, which is referring 
to a position or velocity vector, respectively. The following structure shows all currently
implemented coordinates in `ExESS`:

```julia
ExESS
└─ AbstractCoordinates
    │
    ├─ AbstractPosition
    │  ├─ GlobalCartesianPosition{T<:Real}
    │  └─ GlobalSphericalPosition{T<:Real}
    │
    └─ AbstractVelocity
       ├─ GlobalCartesianVelocity{T<:Real}
       ├─ LocalCartesianVelocity{T<:Real}
       └─ GlobalSphericalVelocity{T<:Real}
```

More information on the mathematical description of the different coordinate vectors are
presented in the [(2.1.1 - Cartesian and Spherical Coordinates)](/documentation/math_num_comp/coordinate_systems/cartesian_spherical_coordinates.qmd).
The mathematical foundation for the conversion functions are shown in [(2.1.2 - Spacial Differentials)](/documentation/math_num_comp/coordinate_systems/spacial_differentials.qmd),
and [(2.1.3 - Temporal Differentials)](/documentation/math_num_comp/coordinate_systems/tempoarl_differentials.qmd),
