**Highlights**

* Monte-Carlo simulation
* Implementation in Julia Language
* Stationary 2D model
* Neutral exosphere of $\ce{H}$, $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{OH}$, and $\ce{H2O}$
* Solar wind is the only source of hydrogen atoms
* Conversion reactions to connect the different species
* All relevant processes included as distributions

# Goal of the Research
{{< fa check >}} &ensp; Build a framework to show the general influence of conversion reactions on the lunar hydrogen exosphere. Include uncertain pathways for particles with probability distributions. 

{{< fa xmark >}} &ensp; Not predict the exact density of the lunar exosphere!
